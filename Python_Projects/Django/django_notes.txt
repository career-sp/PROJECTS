# we could directy install django through 
>> python -m pip install Django==5.0; 

but in professional work we don't directly install anything into local

we prefer sand boxing, through which our main system will not be affected at all.


## here we are using virtual environment:

Name: uisng pip
command: py -m venv .venv

but here we are using: uv (faster than pip)

pip install uv

use: pip list

Name: using uv
command: uv venv // not working in my system.
